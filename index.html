          <p>
            Led development of a campus AI recycling assistant to classify waste
            and direct users to the nearest recycling sites. Real-time waste
            classification with MobileNetV2 PyTorch model, trained further on
            the TrashNet dataset via Google Colab, boosting accuracy from 40% to
            73%. Implemented Google Maps API to direct users to nearest
            recycling sites according to classification of waste.
