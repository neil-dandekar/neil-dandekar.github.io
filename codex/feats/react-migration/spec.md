now that we've reorganized the codebase, let's port the project over to react. maintain simplicity of the codebase and file organization. maintain the look and feel of the site, but just refactor to react.

then, lets implement the liquid glass components:

use the [liquid-glass.md](codex/react-migration/liquid-glass.md) to figure out how to use the liquid glass react components. use these for the socials buttons (i want the exact shape you have right now so circular and the same size if possible). i also want the footer, navbar, and folders nav containers to be liquid flass components.

those sections should have medium tint to them but the socials buttons should have darker tints. also reason as to how the dark/light theming will work with respect the properties.
