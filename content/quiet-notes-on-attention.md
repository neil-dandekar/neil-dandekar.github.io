I am trying to protect a few minutes of deliberate attention each day.

The note is simple:

- read slowly
- write one honest paragraph
- leave one thought unfinished for tomorrow

None of this is dramatic, but repetition has its own momentum.

When I miss a day, I return without trying to "catch up."
